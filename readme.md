This is the repository for my personal portfolio site. It's named site hub because I followed Joe Maller's git hook post to the letter to make sure it was working, and then never changed the name. I'm a freelance front end web developer looking for work building websites and landing pages for small businesses, nonprofits and individuals. Any questions or comments contact me [matt@mattshanker.com]
