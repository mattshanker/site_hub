      As a freelance web developer I want to work with small and medium-sized business owners to create better experiences for your customers. A great customer experience isn't just nice to have, it can make your life as a business owner easier and more profitable by helping you better address your customer's needs. Your customers want access to information about your business at all times, not just during business hours, and in all places including on their mobile device. Not meeting this expectation can make a new customer wary of wasting their time trying to track you down to do business. If you're directing new customers to anywhere online besides your business website, you're giving up control to a company that wants to sell advertising, which your customers don't want. Contact me today and I'll show you how to use what you already know about your customers to build an online experience that exceeds their expectations and helps you deliver a product or service you can be proud of.
