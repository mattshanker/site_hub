        <h4>Responsive Web Design</h4>
            <p>Media queries, adaptive content and grid layout allow your site to respond to fit any client's screen. Now customers don't have have to pinch and zoom your desktop site. Get the feel of an app without the app store.</p>

        <h4>Dynamic vs Static</h4>
        <p>Content Management Systems aren't the right choice for everyone and the added complexity can make them a headache for anyone not making use of the CMS a few times a month. Static sites are built and served using only HTML/CSS/JS and content updates to these sites come from making changes to these files directly. If you don't need to change you content more than 1 or 2 times a month and would rather have a more secure and maintainable site, ask about making your project static.</p>

    <h2>Landing pages - your site's welcome mat</h2>
    <h5>What happens after someone clicks on your ad or email</h5>
    <p>A landing page acts as a greeter, aimed at converting someone's interest into further action, like buying or subscribing. If you've ever clicked on a company's ad or email and then felt lost or disoriented, that is a place where a landing page would have helped keep your momentum going.</p>

    <h4>Data driven marketing</h4>
    <p>One of the biggest advantages digital marketing has is it's ability to collect data about how users interact with your business. Website analytics, email stats and social media metrics all add value by showing where adjustments can be made.</p>

  <article class="content">
    <h4>Onboarding + Automation</h4>
    <p>As the owner, you can spend your time with qualified customers and your customers get timely answers to their questions. Email autoresponders, contact forms, and document uploads can all have attached automation that facilitates your customer's experience and your workflow. Creating an on-boarding process for your business gives you back your time to focus on delivering the best product or service for your customers.</p>
