  <h3>Everyone has an origin story. Here's mine...</h3>
  <p>I started in web development after I realized marketing was considered a commodity discipline, and decided I wanted to make things. So, I decided to start by building a weather app for my Android phone based on the DarkSky API. I estimated it would take me a weekto get something that worked, and another week to polish it to my liking. This would prove to be a naive estimate.</p>
  <p>After taking a week to install the Eclipse environment and the Android SDK, and inventing a few new profanities along the way, I abandoned the idea of an app altogether, and pivoted to websites. Not because the task was too challenging (okay, maybe a little) but because websites can be accessed without an App Store, on any device. I also wanted to take advantage of not having to start completely from scratch with web development, having some experience making edits to a MySpace page back in the days when they were a requirement for teens the way smartphones are today. After spending the next year learning about responsive web development, I decided I wanted to make it my career.</p>
  <p>I work hard to keep informed of the latest techniques and bring that knowledge to each and every project I take on, giving you piece of mind that when you hire me, you're hiring someone who is up to date on the latest in modern web development. <br /></p>

  <h3>Why Freelance?</h3>
  <p>Tell people that you're a freelancer and they think you're just clever about being unemployed. The truth is that for organizations of a certain size, freelancers offer the best value and balance between an agency that might see the job as too small to be worth it, and someone who may have made a webpage or two in the past by may lack knowledge of modern standards or professionalism.</p>
