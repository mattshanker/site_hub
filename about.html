  Starting with your design, logo, and color scheme, I'll help you build a website that's fast and useful for you and your customers. Using HTML and CSS I can layout your content in a way that makes sense to new customers.

   Being a buzzword doesn't make something bad, just misunderstood. Let me show you what inbound can do for you and your business.

  Maintenance: <br> Site not up to code? I'll take over where someone else left off and help you get back online. <a href="contact.html">Contact me</a> for a timeline for getting you back on track.

<h4>I don't work in...</h4>

<p>
  Back-end development: server-side development has it's own set of quirks that demand a developer's full attention. I focus on the front-end, also referred to as "client-side". You can't avoid the server entirely (you have to deploy your site somewhere) but PHP forms and deployment are easier to handle for me than a database.
</p>

<p>
  App development: iOS apps are written in either Objective-C or Swift, and Android apps are coded in Java, which has zero in common with JavaScript. I'm focused on the browser.
</p>

<p>
  Design starting from scratch: Do yourself a favor and hire a designer if you're starting from a blank page. They can give you the best idea of what's possible with line and color. I do that too, but for your business on the web.
