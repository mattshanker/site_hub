  <h1>About Me</h1>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    As a freelance web developer I want to work with small and medium-sized business owners to create better experiences for your customers. If you're directing new customers to anywhere online besides your business website, I can build you an online experience that exceeds their expectations and helps you deliver a better product or service.
  </p>
  <h4><a href="webdev.html">Web Development</a></h4><br>
<p>
    Development is the implementation of design through code. Creating a website that can excel on small and large screens is a requirement for modern business and can be achieved through HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery and other front-end frameworks designed for mobile.
</p>
  <h4><a href="inbound.html">Inbound Marketing</a></h4><br>
<p>
    Do you find yourself getting the same questions from your customers over and over again? Inbound marketing strives to address that and think about your business from the customer's point of view to see if the process can be automated in any way.
</p>
  <h4>Maintenance:</h4> <br>
<p>
  Site not up to code? I'll take over where someone else left off and help you get back online. <a href="contact.html">Contact me</a> for a timeline for getting you back on track.

      Back-end development: Not a full-stack dev (...yet)
    </p>
    <p>
      App development: iOS apps are written in either Objective-C or Swift, and Android apps are coded in Java. I'm focused on the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Design starting from scratch: Do yourself a favor and hire a designer if you're starting from a blank page. They can give you the best idea of what's possible with line and color. I do that too, but for your business on the web.
